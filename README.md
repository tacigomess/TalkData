# Project: Leveraging Generative AI to Communicate with Your Data, Create, and Interpret Graphs

The goal of this project is to explore the use of generative artificial intelligence to empower knowledge holders to independently conduct research and create their own charts, facilitating more complex and spontaneous analyses. By adopting this approach, the need for SQL expertise or specialized tools like Tableau or PowerBI is minimized. Using advanced AI models, the project aims to develop solutions that simplify interaction with data, allowing users to generate intuitive and informative visualizations from raw data and gain valuable insights in an accessible and visually appealing manner.
